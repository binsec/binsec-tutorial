# Introduction
</center>

**BINSEC** is a binary level code analysis platform developed at [CEA List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) ([Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)) in collaboration with [UGA](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) and [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/).

**BINSEC** takes as input a binary file containing machine code instructions and can perform symbolic execution ("*under-approximated semantic exploration*") over it.

This tutorial covers the basic usages of the **BINSEC** symbolic execution engine over small binary executables.
